# Topics

# Data representation

* How is data (numbers for now) represented in memory?
* Positional encoding (Decimal, Binary, Hex,...any base)
* Number conversions 
* Big idea: 
	* Bits can represent anything!
	* Data is stored in memory using finite number of bits (use this to determine range of values that can be stored in any type)
