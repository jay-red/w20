## Premlimaries to Makefiles
* Basics of code compilation in C++ (review)
* Makefiles (used to automate compilation of medium to large projects)consisting of many files
* We will start by using a makefile to compile just a single program
* Extend to the case where your program is split between multiple files
* Understand what each of the following are and how they are used in program compilation
- Header file (.h)  
- Source file (.cpp)
- Object file (.o)
- Executable
- Makefile
* Compile-time errors
* Link-time errors

## Automating compilation using makefiles
* [read about Makefile](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/16wiki/index.php/C%2B%2B:_Separate_Compilation_and_Makefiles)
* Compile-time errors
* Linker errors
* Header guards
* Refer to Professor Wang's detailed notes on makefiles: [https://ucsb-cs32.github.io/f19/lectures/lect01/](https://ucsb-cs32.github.io/f19/lectures/lect01/)

## C++ Memory Model: Heap vs. stack
* Dynamic memory allocation: new and delete
* Stack vs. heap
