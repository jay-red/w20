Read Chapter 7.1 - 7.2 up to page 397. Also read this handout on Pointers and Memory: [http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf) Upload your answers as a pdf to the h06 assignment on gradescope. 

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!<br/>


1.(2 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out. Briefly justify your answer.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int arr[5];
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i < 3) arr[i] = 'a';
  else arr[i] = 'z';
  cout << arr[i] << endl;  }
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
2.(2 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int arr[7] = {5};
for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
  cout << arr[i] + i <<" ";
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
3.(2 pts) What is the output of the following code? If there's an error that will not allow an output, point it out.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int codes[] = {44, 66, 83, 973, -977};
for (int count : codes) {
  if ( (count/2) < 50 )
    cout << count << endl;
  else cout << "invalid" << endl; }
```
</div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>


4.(8 pts) Write the definition of a function named 'reverse' that takes two parameters: an integer array and the number of elements of the array. The function should reverse the order of elements of the array. The function should not return anything. See below for an example of expected outcome when the reverse function is called:

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int nums[] = {10,20,30,40,50};
reverse(nums, 5);// The order of elements should be reversed after this
for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
   cout<< nums[i]<<" "
```
</div>
The output of the above code should be: 50 40 30 20 10
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

5.(2 pts) List two reasons why you might choose to pass parameters to a function by address or reference, rather than by value in your C++ programs.
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

6.(4 pts) Draw a pointer diagram to demonstrate how the state of memory changes as the following code is executed. Cross out old values/arrows and draw new ones. Is this program likely to result in a segmentation fault? If so, why?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

<div markdown="1">
```
   int num = 10, *ptr1 = &num, *ptr2=0;
   if (ptr2) ptr1 = ptr2;
   else if(ptr1) ptr2 = ptr1;
   (*ptr1)++;
```   

</div>
