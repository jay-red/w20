## Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULA)
In addition to the intructor and TA, there are several ULAs in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours). Below is the schedule for ULA closed and open lab hours:

   <b> Adarsha Poudel (ULA) </b>
   <i> "Hello, everyone. I am Adarsha Poudel(he/him/his). I am originally from a mysterious land of southeast-Asia called Nepal. I moved here two years ago, and now I currently live in Santa Rosa, California(NorCal). I'm a first year CS major planning to minor in math. I am very excited to be tutoring for CS 24. I took CS24 last quarter with Prof.Mirza(she is an amazing professor), and I found it very interesting. It actually changed the way how I used to think about coming up with solutions that just works (but is very inefficient). After learning concepts such as Big-O and data structures such as Binary Trees in CS24, Stack, and Queues; I realized I could write the same solution which works very fast and efficient. I'm sure you guys will also find it interesting eventually. Just to let you know guys, it's actually the first CS course that helps you get trained for the interviews for internships. Outside the class, I try to improve my coding skills by solving mathematical-oriented CS problems in sites such as projectEuler and Hackerank, so I recommend you guys to check it out to see if it sparks some interest on you. This is my first quarter tutoring here, so I'm thrilled to share my knowledge and also improve myself interacting with you guys. If you any questions, please don't hesitate to ask even when you feel like its a stupid question. You can't improve if you leave a concept that you don't know unanswered. Hope, you guys will enjoy the class." </i>
