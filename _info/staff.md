## Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULA)
In addition to the intructor and TA, there are several ULAs in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours). Below is the schedule for ULA closed and open lab hours:

  <b> Zhiyu (Zoe) Chen (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi! I’m Zhiyu, a first year graduate student of computer science. I’m very excited to be the TA for CS16 class this quarter. This class gives you deeper knowledge of computer science world and guides you to be a great programmer. I hope all of you will enjoy it. Outside the class I would be happy to share and discuss with you everything related to computer science studies, advice on programming, careers or research, etc. Feel free to contact me on Piazza" </i>

  <b> Bryanna Phan (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, my name is Bryanna and I’m very excited to be a tutor this quarter! You’ll probably see me at Coders SB meetings, so ask me about our events if you’re looking to get more involved on campus whether it be through this club, SB Hacks or the other wide variety of options. This quarter I’d definitely like to focus on helping students to solidify their problem-solving skills and to not be daunted by the programming assignments (trust me, I know how that can feel). Outside of class, I really love traveling, dogs, ping pong/badminton (even tho I’m not great), and tea :-) Feel free to reach out with any questions you may have on Piazza." </i>

  <b> Barbara Korycki (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Barbara but my friends call me Barbs, or the occasional Babs. I’m a third year CS major and have been tutoring since last winter. As an intro-level course, CS16 is interesting to tutor because of the diversity in the students’ backgrounds, course-goals, majors, interests, etc. So this quarter I would like to focus on individualizing my approach in guiding my mentees; help P/NP non-majors grasp the basic foundational concepts, advise those who feel lost/confused/inadequate in their place in engineering (we’ve all been there), and challenge students who are more experienced and would like to take the course material to a more in-depth level. I also just came back from a semester abroad in Copenhagen if you would like advice on studying abroad as an engineer! 
Feel free to reach out whenever over Piazza  :-)

  <b>  Madhu Kannan (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Madhu, and I’m so excited to see all of you this quarter! I’m a third year CS/English double major, and I tutored CS 8 last quarter. I am also the secretary for Engineering Student Council, the student group that plans events for CoE undergraduates. CS 16 was the first class I ever took at UCSB, and it was fundamental to helping me understand what programming was and how I was going to use it for the next four years of my time here. I hope that I can help all of you come to that understanding as well, and leave this class feeling confident about you and your skills. In my spare time, I love reading books and binge-watching TV shows with my friends. (Who doesn't?) If you ever need advice on anything - from class assignments, to planning your courses, or even just a sympathetic ear if you’re having a hard time - you can always reach me on Piazza. :)

  <b> Yossi Hertzberg (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Joseph, but everyone has always called me by my nickname, Yossi. I am a third year CS major and I am very excited to be one of your tutors for CS16. I worked as a tutor in high school as well, and I loved finding ways to make some of the same topics that I struggled with in a class less confusing for the next generation. I took CS16 during my freshman year here, so I hope to be able to help in this same way. I actually started at UCSB as a Mechanical Engineering major but found (eventually) that CS was much better for me, so I can help with many questions regarding major switching, especially into the CS department. Also, I love helping people see how to approach problems algorithmically in a way that a computer can understand, as this knowledge will help in all CS classes, and in any programming language. Outside of school, I love surfing, mountain biking, and playing with my two dogs. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions on Piazza.
